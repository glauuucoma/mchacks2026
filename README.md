# SentiTrade

Ever have difficulty understanding stocks? SentiTrade is here to make your trading simple, reliable, and clear. Choose the sources you trust for your financial decisions, whether it’s news, social media, AI model forecasts, or standard market metrics. 

## About 

SentiTrade fetches information from multiple data sources — current and historical stock prices, as well as standard market indicators. It performs AI time series forecasting of this data, but also includes contextual market behavior data in its recommendations, including from news, web searches, social media (Reddit), and congressional trading activity. Customize which information you find most trustworthy, tailor your preferences based on how much you want to rely on each source, and combine all signals into a clear, actionable trading recommendation.
